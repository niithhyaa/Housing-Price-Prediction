# Housing-Price-Prediction
An end-to-end machine learning project to predict median housing prices in California using Scikit-Learn pipelines.

## California Housing Price Prediction üè°

This is based on chapter 2 of the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" 

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project to predict median housing prices in California, based on the 1990 census data.

This project follows the complete machine learning workflow, from data fetching and exploration to model fine-tuning and final evaluation. The main goal is to build a robust model that can predict the median house value for a given district.
